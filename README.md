Moore led the Web Concepts Team at Squarespace. The Web Concepts team produced conceptual, experimental work. The team built the nearly impossible, with the hope of uncovering the inevitable. The team took their ideas from hypothesis to prototype using experimentation, and incorporate successful projects into Squarespace’s own websites, products, and partnership sites.

Dan attended Rochester Institute of Technology for Computer Engineering but dropped out.  He holds a Masters of Tangible Interaction Design from Carnegie Mellon University’s School of Architecture.  While pursuing his Master’s at CMU, Moore studied: Interaction, Media, Video Game, Experimental Game, and Virtual-Reality, Design.  His master’s thesis is titled the Fundamental Design Principles of Virtual-Reality: Reinforcing Presence through the manipulation of Space, Distance, and Gaze.  Dan has contributed to several open source graphics projects including openFrameworks.  

Moore leverages media frameworks, game engines, textiles, and robotic arms to create immersive environments that examine human behavior, pop-culture, and culture dichotomies. His work is inspired by the idea of HYPE and the manipulation of media to achieve it. Moore strives to create a fully immersive environment for the audience to not only experience but become an active participant in the work. 

Much of Moore’s work takes the form of postvideo nongames, a concept and phrase confined by Moore to describe virtual environments and virtual realities he builds with a game engine that employs an abstract, non-linear narrative and lacks the traditional video game risk-reward feedback loop.  In his work, the audience is given agency to explore the world on their own terms with the opportunity to play, discover, and destroy the environment around them.  Moore explores the performative nature of the interactions between the audience and his work often capturing these artifacts. The episodic nature of Moore’s work can be seen in his many ongoing series and editioned installations.
